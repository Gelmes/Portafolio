I have always been intrigued by science and engineering. From a young age I formed hypotheses, conducted experiments and created things out of old junk I could find in my garage. Throughout high school I pursued engineering, but after graduating did not immediately enroll in college. After trying and failing at a series of businesses I realized that it was time to go back to school. MSJC has offered a new lease on life and passions. Through the stem club on campus I was able to network with other like minded engineers become apart of the Nautilus team. Though inexperienced I have a passion to learn and intend to catch on quick.
