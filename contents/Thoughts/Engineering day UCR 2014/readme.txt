Engineering day happens every year in the week of February 22. Me and the 2014 Robosub team showed up to the Univercity of Riverside to talk about our submarine and the competition. A lot of poeple showed up but it was mainly composed of young kids who were touring the campus for the day. Next time you are around Riverside give a tour around campus and check out what everyone has out there are some cool science experiments on display.
