We will be happy to send someone over to sing, dance, or act out your message to the recipient. We dress up to do it, in anything from a tuxedo and top hat to a gorilla suit! 

 

Our Singing telegrams spread cheer by bringing laughs into the workplace, home, public engagement or party.  

Let her know you still find her sexy in a creative and funny way! Is a friend feeling a little down after a break up? Invite her to coffee at your favorite java hut at a prearranged time. Imagine her reaction when a man walks in, stops, take a second look at her, and breaks into chorus! 

Singing telegrams can be a hoot, especially when personalized. You can write the words yourself, usually by changing the lyrics to a well-know    song</p>
