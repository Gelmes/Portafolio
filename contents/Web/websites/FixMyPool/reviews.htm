<h3>Reviews</h3>
<br/><br/>
<p class="style-1">A friend told us about your Pool service and said we should give it a try. When Dante took over our pool and spa service there we’re lots problems and leaks due to years of a pool guy who only stayed 5 or 6 minutes each stop. At first we thought this was how all Laguna Niguel pool service companies work. Now after 2 years Dante asked me to write quick review about his service. All I can say is “since Dante took over our pool the problems vanished with the old pool guy”.</p>

<p class="style-1">Hi Dante</p>

<p class="style-1">I am just blown away by your great service.</p>

<p class="style-1">The spa is already sparkling ~</p>

<p class="style-1">You were so generous with your time during the consultation and so full of numerous facts about all the equipment we have, I just wish I had started out with you guys from the beginning!</p>

<p class="style-1">I am so greatful I called your company.</p>

<p class="style-1"><strong>Many thanks,</strong></p>

<p class="style-1">"I have used SC Pool Techs for well over 3 years now and am very pleased with their service. Not only the pool and spa maintenance, but the customer service as well. Any time I have a question or concern they have been more than helpful and timely in taking care of any concern I may have. Whether it be regarding chemical use, maintenance suggestions or even Pebble Tec repair, I feel they have made sure I get the answer and service I desire at a fair price. I wasn't even aware that they can handle most anything involving pools until I called with advice for our Pebble Tec repair needs. They did a beautiful job. Customer service is key in my book and they always deliver."</p>

<p class="style-1">Dante, my pool has never looked better! It has been more than 4 years since I hired your company and the level of service has not changed since you started. My wife thought once you guys got comfortable you would start the usual tricks like all the other San Clemente pool service companies have (and we tried um all) But nope, your service is very professional and it shows! Thank you!</p>
