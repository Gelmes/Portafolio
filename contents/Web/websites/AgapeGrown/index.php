  <h2>Graphic Design</h2>
  <p class="style_1">Graphic design has been essential to every era of publishing history and now is a profession in the midst of enormous change. A superficial argument would state that graphic design has been diminished by the Web. But in fact it has been enhanced. Why?

On the Web, appearance and usability are often of equal (or perhaps even greater) importance than content.<a href="service.php"> Read More</a>
