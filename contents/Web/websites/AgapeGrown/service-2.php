  <h4>GRAPHIC DESIGNING</h4>
  <p class="style_1">
  Graphic design has been essential to every era of publishing history and now is a profession in the midst of enormous change. A superficial argument would state that graphic design has been diminished by the Web. But in fact it has been enhanced. Why? In previous publishing eras content was often of equal or greater importance than the appearance of the content. On the Web, appearance and usability are often of equal (or perhaps even greater) importance than content.
A  well-designed website, regardless of its other qualities or shortcomings, draws more visitors than one that is poorly-designed. Consider two websites of equal virtue in their content: the best-designed with the greatest ease-of-use will win the day.  </p>

    <h4>SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING</h4>
  <p class="style_1">
  Search engine marketing is highly-effective for pulling qualified visitors to your website. Both organic search engine optimization (SEO) and pay-per-click (PPC) can be among the best performing and most cost-effective marketing channels.
  </p>
  <p class="style_1">
  Social media marketing provides a way for businesses to get the word out to their target audience in a way that was never available before.
This article outlines a number of methods for getting the most out of your social media marketing.
This is the most common technique that the “experts” promise to do. This includes creating and maintaining a blog and Twitter Account,
engage people who are interested, share valuable things in your industry, and eventually build up followers, visitors, and trust.
It might even involve maintaining a Facebook Fanpage (not effective if you DO NOT already have a strong brand established) or a LinkedIn group.
This technique is effective because it fully utilizes the SOCIAL part of social media. You are out there engaging your target audience.
You are making friends with them and creating value for them. You are building your own popularity and trust. If someone knows what you do and
thinks positively of you, when they need your product or services, they will not go on Google and find a random service they don’t know.
They will buy it from you. If their friends are looking for services you offer, they will refer their friends to you.
  </p>
  <h2>Some of the methods of social media marketing we use are:</h2>
  <p class="style_1">
  <ul class="white">
  <li>Geo-location services like Google Places, Facebook, Foursquare and others to check your physical location and make local connections.</li>
  <li>Facebook advertising to reach a highly targeted, active audience.</li>
  <li>Social search to integrate status, social media profiles and other elements to create a cohesive online brand.</li>
  <li>Personal branding to ensure you’re saying the right things, even when you aren’t saying anything.</li>
  <li>Social media PR using Twitter and other networks to promote real time messages about your business.</li>
