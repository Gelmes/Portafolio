      <h1>FAQ's</h1>
      
            <h2>Why do faucets leak?</h2>
      <p class="style-1">Leaks occur when seals inside the faucet become dirty or worn. Though you may choose to replace worn parts, replacing your old faucet with a new one can upgrade the look of your kitchen, bathroom or tub/shower decor and avoid further repair problems.</p>
      
            <h2>Why do some faucets cost so much more than others?</h2>
      <p class="style-1">Some faucets are simply made better than others with higher quality materials such as solid brass or chrome-plated solid brass to achieve superior levels of appearance, performance, and durability. Although you may pay more for a quality faucet, you will receive a higher value for your money as a result of a longer-lasting and more reliable product.</p>
      
            <h2>Can I replace my two-handle faucet with a single-handle faucet?</h2>
      <p class="style-1">The answer in most cases is yes. Generally, faucet dimensions and sink openings are standard throughout the plumbing industry. There are few exceptions however, so it is a good idea to check sizes first.</p>
      
            <h2>How should I clean polished brass faucets?</h2>
      <p class="style-1">To remove dry water spots, use warm water and a soft, damp cloth. Never use cleansers that contain abrasives, harsh chemicals, alcohol or other solvents. To maintain the lustre of your decorator faucet, occasionally apply a high quality automotive wax - making sure that it does not contain abrasives.</p>
      
            <h2>Why doesn't my old water heater work as well as it used to?</h2>
      <p class="style-1">This is usually due to a sediment buildup in your tank. As water heaters grow older, they accumulate sediment and lime deposits. If these deposits are not removed periodically, the sediment will create a barrier between the burner and the water, greatly reducing the water heater's performance level. This results in an increase in the amount of fuel required to deliver hot water.</p>
      
            <h2>What is meant by a "pressure balancing" shower faucet?</h2>
      <p class="style-1">A pressure balancing shower faucet senses fluctuations in hot or cold water pressure, caused by actions such as flushing toilets or starting dishwashers. A pressure balancing valve compensates for these fluctuations, keeping the water temperature constant and comfortable.</p>
      
                  <h2>Water and Gas Lines</h2>
      <p class="style-1">Location and repair of leaks, replacement of faulty lines, installation of new lines, and rerouting.</p>
