A domain name is like your phone number, people can use it to access your website; the difference is that you can choose your domain name as long as it has not been take already. An example of a URL would be “www.mywebsite.com”.  When a person wants to go directly to your website they will type it on the URL bar located on top of their browser window.  From there your browser will pull the files you have uploaded to you hosting provider and your website will pop up in their computers.
