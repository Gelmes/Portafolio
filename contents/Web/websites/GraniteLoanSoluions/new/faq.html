        <h4>Frequently asked questions</h4>
        </div>
<div class="wrapper">
<p class="color-3">Will all of the loans to be purchased truly be non-performing loans? If so, please provide your definition of that term.

<p>All loans will be purchased as non-performing loans (meaning the mortgagor is delinquent on regular payments). The levels of delinquency can range from as little as 30 days to 2+ years.</p>
<p class="color-3">What is the expected principal balance of the loans to be purchased (provide a range)?</p>
<p>In general, expected principal balance on the purchased loans can vary from $20,000 to $250,000. If a good opportunity presents itself, Granite may at its discretion also purchase assets with higher loan balances.</p>
<p class="color-3">What is a typical discount for loans in the pool?</p><b>This will vary based on two primary factors:</b>
<br><br>Severity of delinquency: Higher delinquency loans are considered higher risk loans and are therefore available at steeper discounts.
<br><br>Loan to Value: Higher loan to value assets are considered higher risk loans and are therefore available at steeper discounts.
Are all of the sellers of the loans expected to be financial institutions?
<br><br>
<p>In general, our range should fall between 10% - 25% of the unpaid balance (UPB). However this is based on demand-supply characteristics and is likely to change as market conditions change.</p>

<p class="color-3">Are all of the sellers of the loans expected to be financial institutions?</p>
Granite will look at multiple channels for acquiring mortgage assets. Although the primary source of assets is expected to be banks, the sellers can include but will not be restricted to banks, thrifts, credit unions, institutional and retail private equity funds, family Offices, hedge funds and other sources.<br><br>
<p class="color-3">Will all of the loans be first deeds of trust, or will there be seconds as well?</p>
All loans acquired will be 1st trust deeds<br><br>
<p class="color-3">How will you handle title insurance for the loans?</p>
All loans will be purchased with Title insurance in place.<br><br>
<p class="color-3">Are there any circumstances you can reasonably foresee in which you would actually hold onto the loan and foreclose on the property?</p>
At this time the focus is going to be on establishing a buyer network and conducting periodic note sales. Although Foreclosure is not being considered currently, the fund will keep all options open to obtain favorable outcomes for the liquidation/disposition of the assets.<br><br>
<p class="color-3"><i>How do you find out about the pools that are available?</i></p>
We are building direct relationships with banks that are periodically selling note pools. We also have relationships with many private equity groups that buy and trade notes with banks and these companies frequently take down assets in partnership with other buyers.<br><br>
<p class="color-3"><i>How does the bidding process work?</i></p>
The bidding process differs from seller to seller. This varies with the different sellers and seller types.<br><br>
The typical due diligence process may look something like this:
<br>
Day 1 : Note tape distributed to potential buyers
<br>
Day 4 : Indicative bids submitted by interested buyers
<br>
Day 6 : Indicative bid winners are acknowledged and allowed access to proceed with Due Diligence process
<br>
Day 7-19 : Due Diligence
<br>
Day 20 : Final Bid Due
<br>
Day 22 : Winning bidder in Contract
<br>
Day 26 : Close sale
<br><br>
<p class="color-3"><i>How do you do diligence on the loans available for sale?</i></p>
This process varies a bit depending on seller processes. Generally speaking, our Due diligence is based on a proprietary model called VOTT (based on value, occupancy, title and taxes).<br><br>

  <h4>We perform two levels of Due Diligence.</h4>
  <h6>Pre-bid phase</h6>
  <p>The pool is analyzed during pre-bid stage to arrive at indicative bid based on perceived risk and comparable yield requirements.</p>
<p>This analysis involves comparing Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or zip code level trend in property prices against every loan in the pool to arrive at potential return on investment under different scenarios. The yield requirements are used to arrive at an indicative price for the pool.</p>
  <h6>Acquisition phase</h6>
  <p>Detailed due diligence is conducted during this phase. This allows us to see what the potential worst and best case outcomes would be given the cost of acquisition, project costs, investor returns and potential exit strategies.</p>

 

<p>Value Analysis: In this phase we use a third party service company called Note Valuations (NV) to establish value. This company contacts and deals with two local realtors on each of the assets. Both Realtors drive the properties to obtain condition and possible occupancy information. Subsequently the realtors work up a CMA (current market analysis report) and deliver it for underwriting and final delivery to us. We ultimately receive two values - 30 Day fire sale and current market value.</p>

 

<p>Occupancy Analysis: We use a company called IAG which calls the utility companies on all assets to establish current occupancy status.</p>

 

<p> Analysis: This is done to establish property profiles with Lawyers Title to see the outstanding liens and to ascertain lien position.</p>

 

<p>Tax Analysis: We also use IAG to obtain current tax information. They contact the county assessors on all assets and obtain current taxes and owed balances.</p>

 

<p>In addition, prior to closing, we also order Broker Price Opinion (BPO) on all properties through First American CoreLogic and O&E reports from the title company (O&E reports provide in-depth title reports showing all chain of title, Current liens,  including judgments, and Jr. liens).</p>
<p class="color-3">Who is on the diligence team? Which Granite entity are they employed by, and what is the contractual and economic relationship between that entity and the Fund?</p>
The management team at Granite Loan Solutions manages the Due Diligence activities. Vendors and strategic partners assist with specific activities.<br><br>

LCAP Advisors: Analytics services during pre-bid, acquisition, management and liquidation stages.<br>
Note Valuations: 30 day fire sale and fair market value (FMV) of properties<br>
IAG: Current occupancy Status and tax information on the properties
Others: For Broker Price Opinion (BPO), title and other services.<br><br>
<p class="color-3">Can you purchase only part of a pool?</p>
<p>When major banks put out pools for sale, they typically only allow the buyer to reject 10-20% of the pool. This is generally because the loans do not comply with certain representations or warranties.</p>
<p>When we purchase pools in partnership with other funds, we can carve out portions of the pool each buyer will purchase based on high-level investment criteria.</p>
<p>When we purchase in the secondary market (non-bank traders) we may have leeway to purchase loans that meet our specific investment criteria. However buyers generally pay a premium for the ability to purchase specific loans from a pool. We will use this channel only under specific circumstances where the acquisition price falls within our investment parameters.</p>
<p class="color-3">Since the loans will be held for such a short time, what role does the servicer play?  What does the servicer charge?</p>
<p>The servicer plays an important role in the management of the acquired loan portfolios. Our servicer is licensed in all states giving them the right to conduct sub-servicing and special loan servicing activities such as collections, skip tracing and campaigns (calls, door knocks and letters). In addition, they send out monthly statements, receive payments (from re-performing borrowers) and make remittances.</p>
<p>While we have some of these rights as the owners of the debt, we use the servicer to conduct most of this work. Once borrower contact has been made we typically instruct the servicer to live transfer the call to our office so we can handle the negotiations for loan modifications.</p>
<p class="color-3">Can you provide two or three paragraphs on the process of selling the loans?  How will you divide a pool up into smaller pools?</p>
<p>The sale process starts with identifying a list of qualified buyers and their investment criteria. Some of these criteria may be hard criteria (for example, a buyer only buys California, Arizona or Nevada loans) whereas other criteria may be soft criteria (such as a preference to purchase loans with outstanding balances in the $50,000 - $100,000 range).</p>
<p>When we have a pool of loans we are ready to accept bids on, we run the pool through LCAP Advisors’s “tranching model”. LCAP’s tranching model converts buyer criteria into constraints which are modeled into simultaneous equations. The constraints are then solved for using an optimizer solution to come up with smaller pools. The goal of constraint optimization is to find optimized (or close to optimized) solutions.</p>
<p>To illustrate with an example, let us assume that a pool has 10 loans, of which 5 loans are in California, 6 loans are owner occupied, 8 loans are collateralized by single family residence (SFR) and 4 loans have outstanding balances between $50,000 and $100,000.  If we have 20 buyers who want to bid on different pieces of the pools, we can quickly see how it becomes extremely difficult to solve this problem in a sequential fashion. Although there are no guarantees that bidders will get exactly what they are looking for, we can apply some of the broad-based hard constraints into the optimizing solution to come up with a smaller pool that will better meet the bidder’s criteria than the original larger pool itself. This process allows us to become a better and more efficient liquidator in the market, allowing us to charge a premium.</p>
<p class="color-3">Who are your buyers?</p>
<p>We currently have a database of close to 3000 leads comprising of institutional and retail buyers and brokers. We will constantly be updating this list and also adding performance metrics based on our experience with them.</p>
<p>Leads will be continually be generated through a variety of sources including webinars, conferences, PR, internet marketing and so on.</p>
<p>Our team also brings with it an extensive database of leads. Our team members have worked at large non-performing loan funds previously and have several qualified buyers with whom they have prior relationships.</p>
<p class="color-3">Will there be a bidding process for loans sold by Granite?</p>
<p>Yes, Granite will follow a first-price sealed bid auction format to accept bids on pools put out for sale. Bidders submit indicative bids based on their own assessment of the pool’s value and willingness to pay. Unlike an English auction format, the bids are not open or called, so bidders do not engage in competition based on relative prices.</p>
<p>If the indicative bids meet Granite’s reservation price, the top bidders will be given access to the loan files to perform detailed due diligence. After the due diligence process is completed, the bidders will have the opportunity to present a final bid. If the final bid is acceptable, Granite will go into contract for the sale of assets.</p>
<p class="color-3">How often will you sell a pool of loans?</p>
<p>We currently plan to put out loan pools for sale once a month. Our goal is to liquidate loans within 90-120 days. However depending specific circumstances, this number can be much lower than 90 days (for example, with simultaneous closing, forward commitments or pre-sold loans) to greater than 120 days (for example, sale of re-performing loans, or specific hard to sell non-performing assets).</p>
<p class="color-3">How do you know that there will be regular demand for the loans?</p>
<p>In the current market, non-performing loans are available at very deep discounts to their outstanding balance. At these discounted rates, the purchase price to collateral value ratio becomes very favorable for generating attractive returns to investors. We are therefore likely to see high demand for this asset class for the next few years.</p>
<p class="color-3">Can you provide a paragraph on the process of restructuring/amending the loans that are eligible for this treatment?  How does this process enhance their value?</p>
<p>The process of restructuring begins with evaluating acquired loans to pick out loans with highest probability of doing modifications. For example, loans with owner occupied properties are good candidates.</p>
<p>The next step is to establish borrower contact. This is done through skip tracing, door knocks and call/mail campaigns. Once borrower contact is established, Granite can use a variety of loan modification alternatives such as reducing interest rate, extending maturity or forgiving part of the outstanding principal balance, to make regular payments affordable for the borrower.</p>
<p>Modified loans provide monthly cash-flows which increases their value. Also, once seasoned, note sale of re-performing loans produce higher returns.</p>
