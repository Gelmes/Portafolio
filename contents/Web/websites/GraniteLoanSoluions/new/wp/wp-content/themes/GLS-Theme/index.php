            As a full time note trader, I can attest to their streamlined, no-hassle method to selling notes.     Their staff is very punctual and professional and their business model of providing the customer with the entire collateral package, which includes recent BPO’s and title reports, makes for a much quicker due diligence period when evaluating note portfolios. </blockquote>
