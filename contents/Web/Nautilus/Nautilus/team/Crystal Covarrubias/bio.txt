I first became interested in engineering after attending a week long STEM seminar and hearing awesome things from engineers and how great their careers are. I’ve always been inclined to participate in anything that sparks my interest and I noticed that I really enjoyed robotics and mechanically based competitions. I absolutely love the idea of being able to create amazing machines and devices to make everyday life easier.
