Technology has always interested me since I was young. After taking a computer science class in high school, I knew what career I wanted; I found programming to be a fascinating thing, and I enjoyed  solving problems as I caught on quickly. Learning about STEM since then has been a fun and engaging experience, and I look forward to expanding my knowledge just as my teammates have done in pursuing the engineering field.
