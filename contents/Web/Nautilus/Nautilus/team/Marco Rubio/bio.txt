My interest in S.T.E.M. has been with me since I was a child. Ever since I had the ability, I would take apart my toys and create new things out of them. My lack of toys as a child pushed me to try and find ingenuous ways to entertain myself, you would often find me making my own toys. This has stayed with me ever since, and I still take apart what ever I can get my hands on.
