Seeing how things work and come together and making them better has always been my calling. From gears meshing together to seeing a piston retract pneumatically, mechanics have always fascinated me. Since my childhood, I have always had the mentality of a fabricator – while something may be out of sight, nothing is out of reach. If something doesn’t fit, make it fit. Cutting, bending, mending, and drilling, all with the finesse of a watchmaker and the power of a jackhammer, anything is possible. I strive to make ideas come to life.
