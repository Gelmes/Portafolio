#### SkateBuddy Website
###### by Marco Rubio


Many of us have business ideas for the future we hope to one day accomplish. Not long after I had learned to work with php and databases I got the urge to create a social network for skaters. This is where the idea of Skate Buddy came into play. Skate buddy would be a social network for skateboarders where they could add their friends and find the right time and place to meet up and skate together. The sight was focused on ease of use, sleek design, and modern appeal.

Not long after its creating did mobile apps become popular and the struggle with the complexity that quickly became of the sights creation halted the project. I no longer feel this is adequate for todays websites since a new database model, mobile friendly design, and security are to be upgraded.

I still learned a lot from this project since I had to learn about sessions md5 encryption, SQL queries, and validation. Maybe in the future I might pick up the project again but this time ill be sure to use all my new knowledge to create something that is nice, secure, and user friendly.
