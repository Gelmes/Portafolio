# Portfolio
The end goal of this project is to create an easy to use website that can dynamically update its contents based on the files inside its directory. In other words a content management system (CMS) that uses the files and directories inside to determine the layout and content of the webpage. The layout will be oriented to provide some sort of portfolio layout for people to use.

##End Goals
- Create a template page for users to model after
- Create admin page
- Dynamic page creation
- Support for text thumbnails
- Carousel option in Markdown (Maybe)
- Tile Galley Option in Markdown (Maybe)

##Current Status
- Using this project to develop personal portfolio
- Content is not what will be in final template
- All End Goals need to be worked on
