# Portfolio
The end goal of this project is to create an easy to use website that can dynamically update its contents based on the files inside its directory. In other words a content management system (CMS) that uses the files and directories inside to determine the layout and content of the webpage. The layout will be oriented to provide some sort of portfolio layout for people to use.
